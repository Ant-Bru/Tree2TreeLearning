# Tree2TreeLearning
Deep Learning library for Tree Transductions Learning.

This is a PyTorch/DGL based library for learning of generic deep tree transductions (e.g. tree-to-tree, tree classification/regression, tree-to-sequence).

The library is the deep neural part of the framework developed during the [LISTIT Project](https://dbacciu.github.io/listit/).

This repository provides only the essential modules of the library, for more information and future updated version visit [pyTreeLearn](https://github.com/Ant-Bru/pyTreeLearn).
